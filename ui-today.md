# Thought: UI, today - 
is like the what the earth would have been, with edges, somewhere around the boundaries, the users fall off.
Software needs to be balanced, like a flat bench, or it topples —> solves one problem and over-fits for the problem. 

There is something very limiting about all the softwares, that they are not easy to extend, especially by their users

Software’s unifying theory?
- compute numbers
-  visualization of the numbers 

genes are the software for the living beings, it evolves without a direction to be the best fit. Why can't software evolve in the same way, every user is a new environment. 

The software is limiting the human interaction, software components are a bad proxy for how the physical objects behave. Software reduces the degree of freedom of interacting with an object. 

The software UI/UX need to evolve.
