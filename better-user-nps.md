# User Feedback Collection

- The "rate us" feature sucks; it's bad UX.
- NPS (Net Promoter Score) collection bars on the top of the website suck; they're too far away from the user who is focused on their work.

Something entirely new needs to be built here, where the product can ask a very specific question about a very specific task without adding a new step between the user's transaction completion workflow.

For example:
- When a user encounters a surprise feature that makes them smile, prompt them right then and there with an emoji to capture their feedback.
- When a user is checking out, place a smiley near the checkout cart where the user can tap and keep pressing the emoji to share their love (similar to Medium claps).
