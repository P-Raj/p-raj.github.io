# better user feedback collection mechanism for apps
- the “rate us” sucks, bad UX
- nos collection bars on the top of the website sucks, it’s too far away from the user focused on the work 

something entirely new needs to be built here, where product can ask very specific question on a very specific task, without adding new step between the user’s transaction completion workflow 

eg: surprise feature for the user, that made the user smile, prompt then and there an emoji to capture the user’s feedback 

user checking out, build a smiley near the checkout cart where user can tap and keep pressing the emoji to share the love (medium claps)
