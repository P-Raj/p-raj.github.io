# Software 2.0: Data -> Information

- Use automation to execute repeat tasks faster
	- AI, ML, DL
	- Usage patterns & personalization
- Collaboration & Real Time
	- Complete the task faster, together
	- Send and receive information faster
- Set task completion expectations
	- Uber - where is my cab?
	- Email - when would I hear back, or not?
- Plugins & Integrations
	- Intelligent integration, automatically filter out the required, risky, and optional data
	- Marketplace
- Data Transparency
	- Data transfers from Edge to center, knowledge transfers from center to Edge
- Ideas around the world:
	- IDEA: Write the test cases and let AI figure out the code to pass the tests.
	- KARPATHY: Labelers are the new programmers; they make AI behave in the real world.
	- A16Z: Software needs to shift from input + rules focused to intent focused, where the programmers would tweak the output to the desired format and the code would adapt itself to process the input in a new way. Example: football positions and game, output would be player positions, and a sequence of positions would constitute a play; the coach would then tweak the outputs and AI would adjust weights.
	- A16Z: One expert trains the AI, and a lot of followers are now helped by the AI to achieve the same goals or even improve on the goals. Example: a car mechanic fixing a problem is then transmitted to everyone fixing the car.
	- IDEA: Terminal for web users. Terminal was the first thing when OS was built, and apps relied on the OS terminal to call and serve the app on user demand. Productivity was a single interface to communicate with all the apps and integrate the apps with the desired data, from one app to another.
	- IDEA: A picture is worth a thousand words. If the app can represent words with a picture, ex: if an engineering lead tries to communicate a flow diagram with words -> build a picture.
	- IDEA: Someone has read the document and to what length; who has read what in your mail?
	- IDEA: Ticket system integration (general app integration) with the terminal, where you can delete data from your mail to put in the app.
	- IDEA: Grow with the startup. Processes are integrated into the mail client, and the process can be changed as the organization size changes: ex: code review in the app, ex: inventory management and request in the app.
	- IDEA: Automated folders for the mails, save a copy of the mail options to the people with whom you have shared the mail.
	- IDEA: VR gives you infinite surface area for the app.
	- IDEA: The internet was built to communicate the written word; historically, it's all about communicating the written word. Writing is permanent; it's a form of a bond shared and saved. Speech is fast, writing is slow - balance between fast and slow.
	- IDEA: Time is short and would keep on getting shorter -> focus on your primary work is more important than communication -> communication should be summarized for the receiver.
	- IDEA: V3 for Microsoft/Google app stores

- "The whole history of computer science is one of ever-rising levels of abstraction"
- "There's a tidal wave of newcomers entering our profession, and it's not going to slow down. It's going to pick up speed." - Heather Miller
- "The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise."
- "The purpose of abstractions is to conceal undesirable properties; desirable ones should not be hidden."
- Zero-cost abstraction offers different views of the same underlying data
