Thought: if one gets agitated by the questions, the reasons could be one of the following 
-  they are trying to manipulate you
- don’t have an answer, but putting up a facade 
- saving their ego
- equally confused by the agenda 
- don’t understand the problem they are trying to solve 
- don’t understand clearly the relationship of the question
