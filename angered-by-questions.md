Thought: If one gets agitated by questions, the reasons could be one of the following:
- They are trying to manipulate you
- They don't have an answer but are putting up a facade
- They are trying to save their ego
- They are equally confused by the agenda
- They don't understand the problem they are trying to solve
- They don't clearly understand the relevance of the question
