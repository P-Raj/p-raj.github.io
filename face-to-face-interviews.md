Why is it that people still prefer to meet face-to-face for the interviews, than a skype call or a phone call?

One of the reason I feel is that - the process interview has a lot of friction built into it. 
An interviewer has to take a pause from their work and then - 
- open the mail/ calendar invite
- download the CV
- add interviewee to contacts (on some software - skype, mobile keypad)
- start the call
An interviewee has to take a pause from their work and then - 
- setup the meeting tool
- wait for the call and pick up

The online meetings are 
- agenda driven, 
- to the point, 
- everyone's focus is on getting off the call ASAP, 
- most of the energy is spent in getting the idea across

Whereas, the face to face meetings are about getting to know the other person.
I am an introvert, still, getting to to know about random strangers is fun (sometimes).
- How can this feeling of fun be introduced to the online meetings? 
- How can the online interviews be made more humane? 
- How can we reduce the friction of online meetings?

It's pretty clear with the adoption of remote work-culture that we need to address this problem ASAP.
