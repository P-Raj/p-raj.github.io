# Project: Snowflakes | Private Social network for outliers
- Society carves an individual in its own image
- In a group, individual identity gets lost. A group has its own individuality, the participants conform to this identity
- It's not easy for a node to break-out of the group
- If a group were to be sliced into smaller groups, it would categorize into three categories of sub-groups
  - extremists or conformists: enforcing the group's individuality
  - neutrals: have no views on how the groups should enact
  - confused or troubled: though they have nothing against the group, they just can't seem to fit in; and the group keeps pouncing on such individuals
- Focusing on the confused group, the reason they can't quite seem to fit in, is not because they can't be in a group, rather, they have not found their group, yet.
- Question?: 
  - How to help such individuals find their network?
  - How  to help such individuals to get to a point where they can express their feelings, clearly; and ask their questions, openly?

# Solution:
- A private social network. to find and join a group
  - you have to answer a set of questions: about beliefs, or feeling
  - you have to put forward your own set of questions, feelings and beliefs
  - you can't change your answers, your views
  - your answers would be exposed to the a set groups and individuals, either filtered by the algorithms, or selected by you
  - their answers would be exposed to you
  - now if both sides accept the answers, you become a part of your group.
