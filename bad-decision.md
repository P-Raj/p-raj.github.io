# Thought: Value of clarifying decisions
if one can’t justify their decision, in the clearest terms, and, since the communication has a tendency to get distorted, the directly/indirectly affected people, or the people executing decisions would either 
  - make mistakes 
  - leave the company 
  - criticize the judgment 
  - criticize the leader
  - become indifferent
  - gets confused and their productivity tanks.


It’s a loose-loose relationship if a leader can't justify their decisions, answer the questions openly.
