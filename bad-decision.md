# Thought: Value of Clarifying Decisions

If one can't justify their decision in the clearest terms, and since communication has a tendency to get distorted, the people directly or indirectly affected, or those executing the decisions, would either:

- Make mistakes
- Leave the company
- Criticize the judgment
- Criticize the leader
- Become indifferent
- Get confused, causing their productivity to tank

It's a lose-lose relationship if a leader can't justify their decisions and answer questions openly.
