Thought: About bitcoin
bitcoin is mined
bitcoin's value is pegged on the "gold standard" of computation
only 21 million bitcoin can be mined, just like the gold
bitcoin transactions are like the bank transactions, except that the verifiers can verify a public ledger
making the bank's private ledger, a public ledger (since txn are open, once you know the account owner, you know their wealth. aligned with govts, not aligned with individuals demanding privacy. could be the future.)
taking the salaried ledger checkers, and transforming them into miners. Miners are sort of non-salaried contractors, like drivers for the uber, who would work on demand (aligned incentive)

bitcoin is regulated by the market's demand

The fiat currency used to be pegged on the "gold standard", and not it's regulated by the country's regulators, a selected bunch of economists and policy makers. In response to one of the country printing more currency, other country's can choose to print their own currency or not; thus keeping the exchange rates in check. There is a complex network of country's at play here.

If bitcoin were to become the next generation's currency, it needs a similar complex network, that can change in response to the market's demands.

Bitcoin would become the next generation's default currency, since the next generation would be digitally native. For the next generation, in their mind set, printed currency is no different from the virtual currency. To move out their currency from one ecosystem to the another, they would need to rely on the bitcoin. Like we rely on the gold today.
