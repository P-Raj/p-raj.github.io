# Thought: How new industries/markets are built?

Question to ponder upon is - how to share the screen between two users? How did it start? Who came up with the idea? Why were they able or unable to execute the idea then? What changed later when whole markets were built on the same idea, sometime later?

Enabling IT support - a new industry. General idea - outsource the non-core work. Has been good in since the industrial age. The knowledge workers. Question is - would this trend continue or would it change? What’s the problem with outsourced? - it’s got an agenda if it’s own and might not think about whats best for the outsourcing company. 

Internet - distribution of content. Enabled a whole lot of new markets. 

iPhone - not a new market. Its just following the desktop computing industry. 

Desktop computers - new industry. Helped enable a whole lot of industries. 

Railroad- distribution of physical goods. Internet- Dishank of intellectual goods. Gap - speed of distribution - opportunity. Does this opportunity mean - a new business or a new industry? 

When you become too big to fail, when a lot of of services are being offered by your company, there would come a time when someone else would strip away that particular division away from your company and offer a better solution. 

When the companies stop innovating on a product- is it a time to consolidate the industry or is it a time to build something even leaner and new?

Vertical solutions would probably lead to the next generation of markets - the second order effects. The horizontal solutions (too big to fail) enable the rise of vertical companies. 

Working at a speed of thought can be one of the parameters to identify the possibility for a company to eventually stumble upon a new market defining opportunity. Writing a letter -> sending it with a rider ->> writing a letter -> email it on the internet. New industry. 

What else?
