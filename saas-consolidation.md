# SaaS consolidation/>? What next?

-   In house software
-   Software tools
-   Productivity tools

## Interface unification
-   Via service Integration
-   Or
-   New interface altogether

## Specialization?
-   Data merging for bio is going to be something

  
## Idea
MicroSaaS platform. Built on google sheets. 
Rise of open source first platforms would enable the rise of 
-   stronger IT teams - integration focused 
-   Paid open source developers 
-   Rise of Design studios
-   Rise ff data scientists 

## Idea

A common user interface for all the services, these would be template based (customizable in the future), when one integrates a service in their workflow or user interface, the integration merges seamlessly on the User Interface. 
There would be a lot of assumptions behind the integrations - highly opinionated ! 

? This looks like a V3 all over again.

Problems with integrating the services today - disparate data sources, API based integration, needs IT to be involved, happens behind the scene. Need to identify what data to send where, remove the duplication of the data, build the 2 way communication between the data sources.

A lot of startups are now trying to build stacks (email, doc, messaging, project management) all in one place - 

Benefits
-   single UI and a great experience
-   good place to start with, but not a good place to remain as the company grows the requirements grows and the customers would move onto the vertical platforms

Drawbacks
-   lacks the advanced features of the big vertical platform
-   since the company wants to be a jack of all trades, there isn't a focus on a single module or feature, that means delay in upgrading the company's workflow
-   the startups that are not focussed lack the basic agility expected out of a startup. it would always be harder for the startups to scale the team to build the feature set required by your workflow

Every company is destined to be specialized-vertical first --> horizontal second --> bound to be shredded to specialized again

## Idea
Microservices & FaaS: SAAS subscription
Like Class Pass, you pay for the features you want to use and not the product as a whole. 
- eg - 1 yoga class from 1 app another yoga class for another app. pay just once, subscription will be automatically managed for all the apps in a particular category
- Example 2- HR SaaS subscription
we can choose your favorite features from separate apps pay once and use them seamlessly
