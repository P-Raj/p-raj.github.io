Thought: Abstraction in software and business.

Abstraction, In general, makes software and businesses brittle, by abstracting away the first principles and the fundamentals and the bugs of the underlying system. 

Abstraction makes it easier for the software or the business, to get adopted. This is an incrementalist view. 

The disruption comes, not from going abstract, but by going deep. 

New software would enable the users to go deep, and play with the fundamentals of the system. 

Eg: visualize the data pipelines to the user, or visualize the car in real-time, on the uber’s interface. 

Eg: "Bare metal software":"naked software". Show what’s going on, under the hood, of the software they are using.
