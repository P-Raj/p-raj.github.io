# Problem: Q&A handling while presenting a recorded demo

The video should automatically pause when someone asks a question, the question and the answer should get recorded and transcribed, and video should resume when the discussion is over

-   if the demo is with the PPT, questions and answers should be automatically recorded in the slide notes, so that the presenter, in the future, can include the ambiguous points

-   the understanding of the question varies per listener; if the recording is made available to concerned teams, a more holistic solution could be created
