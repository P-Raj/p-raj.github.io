There are multiple ways to contribute to a product; every good product solves a problem, what’s important here is the problem, and not the solution. 
For the solution, only constant is change; for the problem, the problem never changes, just takes a new form. 

Identifying a problem is far more important than the solution built. Problem has an attribute of being neutral. 
Problem is not biased towards anyone, or anything. Problem is free for anyone to choose to work on it. 
Solutions, on the other hand, have an inherent bias, induced by the solver. 
Ultimately, what this means is, everyone would approach the problem in a different way, in their own unique way; and, this opens up a whole new possibilities of building great products.

No one loves a problem, but their own ideas of a solution. 
You must have heard about the opinions and assholes (everyone has one, and everyone thinks the other’s stinks. Something like this.).
However, if you start loving the problem, you would start listening to other ideas.
This introduces a random mutation in your solution, introduced by the acceptance of another idea, or best part of the idea; this opens up the possibility of boundless evolution. 
(philosophy: Evolution is what gave us cancer, but also made us humans. Imagine a never mutating and amalgamating bacteria, that would have been us, without the evolution.)
