Any size of group can be compared to a small village. May it be a company, or a team, or a set of friends. In a village, whom you like or dislike, matters a lot, as you have to interact with everyone.

Our language is limited to a set of words, but our feelings are boundless. 
While expressing the ideas, we are trying to compress the infinite to fit into a bottleneck of vocabulary. 

While receiving worded-bounded-ideas, we are decompressing those to our own infinite universe.

And, there is no perfect transformation, and there can not be one.

What matters here is giving people a chance to express themselves, whether or not you like the person. 

Things tend to improve, if someone is working on de-escalating the conflicts.
