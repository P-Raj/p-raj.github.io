Somehow, the text on the Internet is not indicative of the feelings of a person. 
In a regular conversation a person might say this and that and whatever and the other person, if is to argue, will argue in a civilized manner.
But, on the Internet it's just text. 
People don't know each other, and when somebody wants to contribute to a discussion, it always takes a round turn, instead of going into building something positive and it always turns into maniacs shouting out loud.
