Prediction 2020

Field: Software - 

Around the start of the decade - 

- Nearly every old SAAS company would become a platform, offering marketplace and hosting for custom built solutions.
- Rise of very narrowly focussed software companies. (superhuman for X trend - to me this means - software with an extremely narrow set of features, with a focus on being fast).
Came True - https://twitter.com/vsodera/status/1297956815297114113?s=20 
- Reduced time to market for software products, followed by a decline in the quality of software (performance, security, speed of building features).
- Rise in number of open-source full-fledged-products.
- Rise of NoCode, would facilitate the Rise of micro-SAAS.
Came True, every company is no-code

COVID Effects - 
Bloodbath in service based companies
FAANG, Salesforce, bigger older tech companies gain platform strength
Software needs to become a tool again, rather than a thing of magic. Everyone uses the software, but the software is coming in between the user and the task.
Design is not how it looks, but how it works
Giants are going to copy the design, but can't beat the product UX or how it works
Consolidation is happening all around the place, every new offering is getting copied by the giants
PM in giants are going to suck the life out of the product --> There in lies the opportunity
Attention span is further going to get shortened, this means software + AI needs to provide user with a decision, based on all the data points required by the user.
Data integration from various sources
Data integration needs to be citizen-driven, no-code, usable, seamless
eg - trader needs to read the IPO doc, the trader can select the type of data required out of the doc, fed to his algorithms, and decision would be taken
it's AI as a compute tool + Human as a decision maker 
Software tools need to be uniform, in terms of the UI and the features, so that anyone can simply adjust the software according to his own job requirements, rather than relearning the software. Innovation within a software vertical is slowing down, all softwares have the same features, configuring a cisco router is same as configuring any run-of-the-mill router provider.
GenZ, the video generation, needs to have a social network that's all video + virtual
VR [boom] + Facebook [boom] + needs an open source eco-system - that's not android or iphone
The discussion forums have to be all video
The blogs have to be all video
what has happened with the games, is going to happen to the job, genz using the software and relaying how they solved the problem
everything becomes a twitch stream
Seamless privacy enablement using AI should be there in the video
Company certifications test needs a reboot, going to test center and paying up a lot of money is no longer worth it. What duolingo has done to the english test, needs to happen to the company-wise-certifications - Azure certified, etc
New hardware + new compiler + energy efficient + affordable + fast = support AI + Quantum Computing + Quantum Network
Instant everything
Hospitals --> doctor on demand + cheap sensors (apple watch) + remote clinic (expensive machines and tests only) + same doctor everywhere (personal doctor)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Around the middle of the decade - 

- Rise of paid Open Source developers.
- Rise of IT dept. in the organizations.
- Data engineering would be a part of IT.
- More organizations would turn to in-house development.
- Rise of FAAS (Feature as a Service) on the top of the SAAS and Open Source, would be facilitated by a small set of team, serving the Enterprise market.
- Every IDE would offer ML based code-completion. This would be adopted quite quickly by the companies, in hopes that tech-debt would be paid.
- Experienced software engineers would consolidate behind the core-tech companies or churn out of the industry.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Around the end of the decade - 

- CS (subject) would just become AI/ML and would follow the path of core engineering degrees, where having a post-grad degree is no longer optional. 
    Would be offered as a combined UG+PG degree.
    Curriculum would be more or less the same, only the name change would happen for the UG. 
    Universities would struggle to attract candidates in the CS stream as the popularity of lambda school and other bootcamps soars.
- CS (subject) would be merged with other degrees to offer combined degrees.
    Curriculum would include the first two years of CS - programming, database, data structure, data engineering, software engineering and some IT subjects around devops.
- Rise of industry, function specific NoCode apps/services.
- PostGres-Rust - relase of postgres, rewitten in Rust (in general - nGinx, Python, not all, but one of the major tech component)

- Day 0 for Sofware industry.
    It bottoms out, before rising up again in the next decade. 
    Mythical man-months would be the bible for the new s/w industry.
- Day 0 for the distributed internet, distributed apps.

- A hardware company, bigger than Intel at its peak.
- First truly distributed organization, start of an experiment.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Random Predictions 

- Amazon would peak.

- Nationalist sentiments are on the rise in India, this might force consumer facing companies to take some drastic measures, such as - Walmart and Amazon to either merge or leave India.
---- This came to be true, but because of corona, the world is planning to move from globalization to localization.
- Gold rates would be all time high.
---- This came to be true, but not because I was thinking about Corona, rather I was thinking about the boom in semiconductor industry and how the software would need new hardware.

- Mental health issues would be on a rise.

- Cloud kitchens/ delivey only restaurants would be a norm.
---- This came to be true, but not because I was thinking about Corona

- Ownership would start moving towards digital (digital money, space in VR land, etc).

- Expect breakthroughs in quantum computing and internet.

- Hope for some progress in self-configurable robots.

- Sharing economy would grow.
---- Might not come to be true because of Corona.
