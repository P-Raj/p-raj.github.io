Tthought: if one can’t justify their decision, in the clearest terms
  since the communication has a tendency to get distorted, the indirectly affected populations by the decision would either 
  - make mistakes 
  - leave the company 
  - criticize the judgment 
  - criticize the leader
  - become indifferent
  - gets confused and their productivity tanks
it’s a loose loose relationship
