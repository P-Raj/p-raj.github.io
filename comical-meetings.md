# Project: Modern Day MoM app
-   reduce the friction of note taking
-   text to speech
-   Primary focus - execution with the keyboard
	-   terminal is faster than the UI, UI changes the page, changes the context, whereas, in terminal the UI does not change, and the actions can be executed quickly
### Problems
- single note-taker

### Solution: shared page, take the notes collaboratively
-   multiple note-takers
-   confusion while merging the notes
-   wasted duplicate efforts
-   no immediate way of sharing and extending the notes
-   Speech to text
-   build points and agendas
-   build discussion threads
-   build decisions and todos
-   record of people agreeing and disagreeing on any agenda
-   record multiple solutions proposed to the problem
-   search old agendas and tasks - help build the timeline of a discussed issues
-   multiple 2-way integrations with other data sources, to keep the MoM agenda upto date
-   automatically tag the issues
-   connect the agendas according to the content categorization
-   build a knowledge-base
-   integration with onboarding services, to help newcomers onboard faster
