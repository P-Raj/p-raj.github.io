importance of value 

without a clear value proposition, you will never be able to answer simple question, what do you do, for whom do you do it for (your customers)! 

what you create, must be clear, concise.

it must be solving some problem

be very active, listen, realize, feel yourself doing the job, feel the pain, solve the pain. Solve enough pains.
