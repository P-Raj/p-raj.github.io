Developer documentation tools are amazing, as they provide a way to stitch together the documentation. 
Further, how can that be a product doc, how can that be a customer-support reference doc? How can that be a sales or marketing doc?

- Align the documentation motivation. 
- Documentation as information. 
- Documentation as a monitoring solution. 

  
# Idea: Automatically document the code

- git commit keeps a track of changes made to the code
- git commit message keeps a track of the \[#issue\]
- \[#issue\] has the the complete description around the problem, description, RCA, documentation, decision 

Align the engineering team with the product and CS teams.

- release docs would automatically be published

Align the engineering team with sales, and the customer\]

- [first](https://www.loom.com/blog/asynchronous-meeting) companies have been moving their meetings, stand ups, onboarding and kick-offs to be asynchronous. It’s not a silver bullet, but makes a lot of sense when your team is spread out across many timezones. Inspired by this, we’ve tried to combine async standup meetings with a local “Stackoverflow” and came up with what we call “Developer Logs”.

# Project Progress-Bar

For every tech tutorial out there, there should be a parallel track progress bar which can provide the user with a set of questions. Based on the quality of the user's answers, the progress bar should suggest the proper track.

Visualization - Tree like structure - parallel to the chapters

-   the concepts would be attached to one another, one or more flowing into each other - thus displaying a proper dependency on the topics a user needs to know before proceeding any further
-   The user can select any topic card and the card expands to display the user with a set of questions
-   practical questions - should you use hashmaps to store integers, etc
-   definition questions - what are hashmaps
-   programming questions - what would be the output of the code
-   this way the user can read about the topics and test their knowledge of the programming language or programming concepts
