Developer documentation tools are amazing, as they provide a way to stitch together the documentation. 
Further, how can that be a product doc, how can that be a customer-support reference doc? How can that be a sales or marketing doc?

- Align the documentation motivation. 
- Documentation as information. 
- Documentation as a monitoring solution. 

  
# Idea: Automatically document the code

- git commit keeps a track of changes made to the code
- git commit message keeps a track of the \[#issue\]
- \[#issue\] has the the complete description around the problem, description, RCA, documentation, decision 

Align the engineering team with the product and CS teams.

- release docs would automatically be published

Align the engineering team with sales, and the customer\]

It’s not a silver bullet, but makes a lot of sense when your team is spread out across many timezones. Inspired by this, we’ve tried to combine async standup meetings with a local “Stackoverflow” and came up with what we call “Developer Logs”.
