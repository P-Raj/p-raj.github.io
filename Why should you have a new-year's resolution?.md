Everyone would already be aware of the jokes that go around with NYRs (new-year’s resolutions). Reading those one-liners, and having delivered a couple of them myself, I gave up on the NYRs, a few years back. Maybe you did as well.

But, this year, I got a different perspective on the NYRs. It’s not what you resolve, rather what made you think about those specific agendas? No one can change their past, or the mistakes already committed. But, everyone can take away some lessons, lessons that no one else could have taught, no classes, no teachers, friends or the parents. And, it’s those lessons that would, eventually, take you to your maximum potential.

NYRs are not simple promises, rather, are a form of self-reflection. They highlight the behaviours, actions/inactions, that you feel could have been better, done better, they sharpen your focus. They are your answer to

- What matters to me?
- What’s holding me back?
- Where am I heading, What next for me?
- Am I working on things that matter to me?

They are also your answer to
- What are my likes and dislikes?
- How I see myself?
- My intrinsic motivation?

No one, I believe, wants to remain static. Every one, I believe, wants to grow. That’s the nature. The reason why some people grow, while others can’t is simply a matter of – what? What should I grow into? How and why come later. Stronger the what, the easier would it be to find “how”, and simpler it becomes to answer “why”.

The best of the potential is lost because we did not spend enough time thinking about ourselves, about our “whats”, “hows” and “whys”.

I, for one, am taking upon myself to resolve to improve this year. Resolve to reach my potential. Resolve to get a clarity on what I want to become.

And, I encourage you to take the leap as well. I leave you with this quote, maybe it would help you build up your courage to face your innermost critic – 

### “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”

- Theodore Roosevelt
