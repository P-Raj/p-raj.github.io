# Thought: Why productivity tools are a bad business
What's the baseline of productivity? What's the peak for productivity? How to define productivity for work?

Most of the marketed productivity tools are simply a monitoring tool to keep an eye on the workers, and to reduce the anxiety faced by the indirect managers. Instead of helping people achieve their tasks, quicker, most tools are simply a layer of added management processes, that comes between a user and their task.

In most cases the productivity does not directly convert to business revenue For eg, does increased number of lines written in the code increases the revenue? does rate of number of lines of code written, increases the rate of growing revenue? Most of the productivity is a pseudo science, sold by management graduates to management graduates.

The productivity comes into play when the output of the worker is directly bound to the sales revenue. Eg: liters of milk produced by the cow, and the milk consumed by the customers. More productive cow can help the owner get more revenue. If one were to imagine building a "modern productivity tool" for the dairy business, it would contain a lot of pseudo-science parameters, eg how many hours have the cow slept, how many times one had to pinch the cow breast to get optimal milk, etc. Most of these parameters would have a correlation to the productivity, but no real impact on improving productivity.

People don't want to pay for the productivity tool, lest it should deliver some value, some direct ROI. To help people raise their productivity level, the tool has to first be configured per person, personalized, and from there, probably, help the user gain skills. If such tools can then relay a proper information to the other productivity system, there might be a universal productivity system, that does not come between the user and the work.

## Q: How to help people get through more information?
provide them with the highlights, according to their level of understanding.
Instagram Stories for everyone
connect the information together, so as to make the reader comfortable with the ideas presented in the collection of links

## Q: Why workplace productivity can be a thing?
 cross-team communication can be hostile, as the teams are focussed on delivering on their own KPI, which might not align with the team they are dependent on. eg: CS v/s product. CS wants a stable product, whereas product wants to "break things fast", the KPIs clash
Every team has their own processes, documentation, silos of information

To align the teams, there needs to be transparency in the system, that can help build trust between the teams. The top managers should have tools to simulate team KPIs and see the longterm impact that this would have on their organization. This could help the teams to be aligned, help the company to reach its goals, and keep the processes in check: the process should not lose their meaning and should keep up with the times.
