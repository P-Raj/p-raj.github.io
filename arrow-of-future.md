# it all started with excel and it’s moving towards excel — enterprise 
software is peaking 
technology is slowing 
best practices are being built into frameworks
users have too many interfaces to switch to, too many UX to adapt to
excel started with data mgmt, and was keyboard driven, the ux is consistent, innovation beyond excel is the best bet for the software. 

# Consumer Tech
no one can guess 
audio video are great, entertaining and faster communicating 
the fun is always in doing things together 
alone you just want to keep scrolling 
get information faster
the creators are again categorized in the enterprise software — ✏️
consumer is about creativity and displays — create the most amazing cake and display for everyone to see 
consumer is about social status 
about - hobbies and distractions 
about- extending things easily- create collages, edit videos, build gif, react with emojis
they don’t decide, they reward creativity with attention and sometimes money, they don’t need data, but the outcome 

# Enterprise to Consumer interaction 
this is an interesting field, as enterprise lacks in building great tools for the consumers 
consumers expect apple like experience on every platform, things working, but companies are usually not able to provide that, since the most creative team is sitting elsewhere, and you are always chasing 

It’s all about the CALENDAR sync
a network over calendar

direct marketing and direct interactions

# what software has become and what would it become 

software started as all great things do, outliers being interested in exploring the possibilities.
Next, it got accepted by businesses. Now, it is finally reaching a phase when it’s truly becoming tool of thought. 
it would be the tool of the rebellious, the artists.

# Thought: about software 
- there are fundamentally 2 types of software - standalone and used by one person to create information and networked software - used to distribute information and collaborate. This means that primary force driving the software forward would differ for both the classes of software. 
- Product should be configurable by the end user, not just how it feels, but how it works. Lego blocks. 
- There is not enough experimentation with the product, primarily because it’s still hard to do A/B testing, have to rely on the tech to code and deliver. The process of thinking of a solution, building it and changing it, is complex, costly, and takes a lot of time. This time to deliver and gather feedback, could be shortened by the component based architecture, micro frontend.

Q: how can marketing build and release a product for the customers to dry run?
- Software should be more intelligent in understanding the user mistakes and then self correcting the mistakes or guessing the intent of the user and only proceeding with the correct input/information from the user. Showing error to the user is a bad ux. 
  New set if frameworks are needed that would have inbuilt analytics for the product and features. Also help developers understand and deliver Improved software with every release. 

Q: auto-pilot for the software? Where the computer does most of the things and suggests the appropriate action. 
- Software needs to get even more vertical to deliver the intelligence. Software as a service —> Feature as a service. Where thr user can just drag and drop features they think would be useful and build their own version of the software, just for their own itch.
