Trying to capture where the world of software is headed?

# Enterprise Tech - it all started with excel and it’s moving back towards excel 
- Enterprise software is peaking. Everyone wants to sell the same thing, some version of Excel replacement, with Forms and Boxed UI
- Pace of technological innovation is slowing. Everyone is simply following everyone else, rather tha building something of their own. And, it's not bad, simply that incentive to build different is not there, and not valued as much
	- Building anything new takes a lot of retakes and time. The Ent.SaaS vendors are competing over the number of features, there is not enough time to rebuild stuff, or even rethink stuff
- Users have too many interfaces to switch, too many UX to adopt. Everyone copies in their own style. Have their own language.
	-  Software adoption is a new challenge faced by the SaaS vendors
- Excel started with data mgmt, the UX was keyboard driven, and consistent. Innovating beyond excel is the best bet for the software, and not happening fast enough.

# Consumer Tech - is all about easier tools to build and share
Audio, video are great
- 24X7 entertainment
	- alone, one just want to keep scrolling
- a picture is worth a 1000 words
	- the fun is always in doing things together 
	- get information across faster

The value 
- lies in creating and showcasing
- is all about 
	- social status 
	- hobbies and distractions 
	- building over the top of or extending things, easily - create collages, edit videos, build gif, react with emojis
The creativity is awarded with the attention and then money.

# Enterprise to Consumer interaction 
It’s all about the CALENDAR sync
- a network over calendar 
- appointment with dr
- appointment with barber
- direct marketing and direct interactions 

(rough: Enterprise software sucks. Bad UI/UX, valuing ROI over creativity
Enterprise lacks in building great tools for the consumers 
consumers expect apple like experience on every platform, things working, but companies are usually not able to provide that, since the most creative team is sitting elsewhere, and you are always chasing)

# what software has become and what would it become 

Software started as all great things do, outliers being interested in exploring the possibilities.

Next, it got accepted by businesses. Now, it is finally reaching a phase when it’s truly becoming tool of thought. 

it could be the tool of the rebellious, the artists.

# Thought: about software 
- there are fundamentally 2 types of software 
	- standalone and used by one person to create information
	- networked software - used to distribute information and collaborate. 
	This means that primary force driving the software forward would differ for both the classes of software.
- Product should be configurable by the end user, not just how it feels, but how it works. Lego blocks. 
- There is not enough experimentation with the product, primarily because it’s still hard to do A/B testing, have to rely on the tech to code and deliver. The process of thinking of a solution, building it and changing it, is complex, costly, and takes a lot of time. This time to deliver and gather feedback, could be shortened by the component based architecture, micro frontend.

Q: how can marketing build and release a product for the customers to dry run?
- Software should be more intelligent in understanding the user mistakes and then self correcting the mistakes or guessing the intent of the user and only proceeding with the correct input/information from the user. Showing error to the user is a bad ux. 
  New set if frameworks are needed that would have inbuilt analytics for the product and features. Also help developers understand and deliver Improved software with every release. 

Q: auto-pilot for the software? Where the computer does most of the things and suggests the appropriate action. 
- Software needs to get even more vertical to deliver the intelligence. Software as a service —> Feature as a service. Where thr user can just drag and drop features they think would be useful and build their own version of the software, just for their own itch.
